2. Basic UI development
3. Working with hotspots and wifi related api's
4. Encryption for stopping another user from using our wifi.

## My Contribution
So, we want to build a system where we can transfer Internet Data through hotspot and the other person receiving the data through wifi will be charged money according to the usage of the Data. This summarizes the whole point of this project.
My Contribution till now is that I have created an app which will create a hotspot(unique name and password generated) in the app itself and then the other person can connect to this hotspot using the app itself. 
The future endeavors are that we want to send data through this hotspot and also the person will be charged according to the usage.
